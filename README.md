# Scripts

## Delete 301 Webhooks

Less experienced users are keen to paste a whole shitload of webhooks with a 301 status, not realizing that most webhooks only support POST operations, while 301 redirects do not.

To help educate, and also get rid of all this extra crap, the `./scripts/delete_301_webhooks.js` script will delete redirects that look like webhooks, but don't use a `307` status code.

For webhooks that look like discord webhooks (99% of them), it also sends a friendly message.

### Running
```bash
export DEPLOYMENT=https://link.iamjakoby.com;
export PASSWORD=password;
./scripts/delete_301_webhooks.js;
```
